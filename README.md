# MTConnectReference

Some terminology

MTCONNECT is a manufacturing technical standard to retrieve process information from numerically controlled machine tools. Some terms: 

Adapter: An optional software component that connects the Agent to the Device. 

Agent: A process that implements the MTConnectÂ® HTTP protocol, XML generation, and MTConnect protocol. 

Device: A piece of equipment capable of performing an operation. A device may be composed of a set of components that provide data to the application. The device is a separate entity with at least one component or data item providing information about the device.

Application (client): the application is the actual requestor and consumer of MTConnect data. Typical 
functions of the application are to request, store, manipulate and display data. The Application includes 
a function called the Client whichinitiates all requests for MTConnect data. The Client is a software 
function in the application that actually requests data from the Agent and translates that data into the 
format required for the application.

Those wishing to get a better feel for MTConnect should check out the lab directory; there is a readme there that should walk you through some basics, or watch the youtube link above. Additionally, this may be a good starting point for creating our own MTConnect platforms
